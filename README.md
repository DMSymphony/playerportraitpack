# Arelith Player Portrait Pack
The Arelith Player Portrait pack is a community-driven and curated project to provide diverse portrait content for characters in Arelith. The Pack is focused on giving players options for a variety of races, species, and genders playable in Arelith in a nicely sorted manner. Images in character creation are sorted roughly based upon gender and fantasy race.

A broad spectrum of ethnicities, as well as the following fantasy races are included: Aasimar, Avariel, Aquatic Elves, Air Genasi, Derro, Deep Imaskari, Drow, Duergar, Dwarves, Earth Genasi, Elves/Half-Elves, Fey, Fire Genasi, Gnolls, Gnomes, Goblins,  Hobgoblins, Halflings, Half-Orcs, Humans, Imps, Kobolds, Minotaurs, Ogres, Rakshasa, Svirfneblin, Tieflings, Troglodytes Vampires, Water Genasi and Yuan-Ti. The packâ€™s overall look is a high quality painterly style, as such it does not allow anime, cartoony or low quality images.

Players are encouraged to submit their portrait images to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VrbfYTa).

## Packaging

The project has been expanded from the popular [Steam Workshop package](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1723483101) to [Neverwinter Vault](https://neverwintervault.org/) to enable GOG and Beamdog Client players to install the pack as well. However, since the portrait folder installation is the "normal" way to add portraits to Neverwinter Nights, this method will work for NWN:EE from the Beamdog Client, GOG, and Steam, on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Full size portraits, and their portrait resrefs, are viewable (as .webp files) at the [Arelith Player Portrait Pack Browser](http://tinyurl.com/APPPBrowser)

The pack will continue to have new submissions added, adjustments to portraits that see little use over time, as well as added portraits for types of characters lacking portrait options.

Note: All artwork belongs to the creators of these pieces and commissioners, and should they request them to be removed, it will be done so immediately and without question. All rights belong to those individuals entirely. 

## Patch Hak
Also available for download is a pre-compiled portraits hak file. This can be used to add all 5 sizes of DDS files to the game with only one .hak file, using the [Patch Hak](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/69487/nwn-ee-userpatch-ini-unofficial-faq) method. This means the only files required for install are the medium TGA portraits folder files, and one hak file.

## UHD version for 1440p and 4k

This portrait pack's smallest four sizes have been scaled to double size for visual quality increases above UI Scale 1.0. Users with UI greater than 1.0 may wish to also download the [UHD Bioware Creature Portrait Override](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwnee/images/portrait/uhd-bioware-creature-portrait-override), which similarly "upgrades" Bioware's Default Portraits to double size, matching the improved detail on Ultra High Definition monitors. Huge portraits, only visible in character creation, remain at their original resolution.

The APPP Patch hak download already includes a line in the userpatch.ini to load the UHD Bioware Creature Portrait Override patch hak, if it is also in the patch folder. If installing the APPP, do not use the userpatch.ini that comes with the UHD Bioware Creature Portrait Override patch hak.
