This folder contains NWN ready image resources for the Arelith Player Portrait Pack.

The Arelith Player Portrait Pack is an optional unofficial portrait collection for the Arelith NWN Persistant World server, and is not considered a "server official" portrait pack. It is a player created and maintained platform providing the server's player community with personal publishing of individual portraits, as well as supplying a diverse curated selection of quality portraits of various species, races, and genders.

The portrait pack is maintained by Zariu, with technical assistance and publishing from Symphony, and Steam Workshop distribution from Spyre.
